            <p>I got into programming when I was in 10th grade all thanks to my wonderful teacher who made learning super fun!</p>

            <h3>Art and Painting</h3>
            <p>I have been into art ever since I learned how to hold a pencil!</p>
            <p>It is not only therapeutic for me but also provides a unique perspective on my work.</p>
